# Wallet Payment System

Welcome to the **Wallet Payment System**! This project is our final deliverable for CS631 DMSD designed to simulate a digital wallet experience, complete with features for managing accounts, sending and requesting money, and analyzing transaction data. It's a great tool to showcase your skills in database management and programming. üöÄ

## Features

### Account Management
- Create, update, and delete users.
- Add or remove email addresses, phone numbers, and bank accounts.

### Money Transactions
- **Send Money:** Transfer funds to users via email or phone.
- **Request Money:** Request payments from other users easily.

### Transaction Insights
- View statements to see total money sent and received within specific date ranges.
- Analyze monthly stats (totals, averages, and more).
- Identify top users with the highest transaction activity.

### Search Transactions
- Find transactions by user SSN, email, phone number, type, or date range.

### User-Friendly Menus
- Navigate through a simple menu system for all functions.

## How It Works
1. **Database Setup:** Initializes an SQLite database to store users and transaction data.
2. **Test Data:** Includes pre-loaded users and transactions for testing.
3. **Interactive Menu:** A command-line interface to manage accounts and process transactions.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python üêç
- **Database:** SQLite üõ¢Ô∏è
- **Date Handling:** Python's `datetime`
